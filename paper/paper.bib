	abstract = {RDF shapes have proven to be effective mechanisms for describing and validating RDF content.Typically, shapes are written by domain experts. However, writing and maintaining theseshapes can be challenging when dealing with large and complex schemas. To address this issue,automatic shape extractors have been proposed. These tools are designed to analyze existingRDF content and generate shapes that conform with the underlying schemas. Nevertheless,extracting shapes from large datasets presents significant scalability challenges.In this document, we describe our work during the 2024 BioHackathon held in Fukushima,Japan, to tackle this problem. Our approach is based on slicing the input data, performingparallelized shape extraction processes, and merging the resulting partial outputs. By refiningour software and methods, we successfully extracted shapes from a subset of UniProt, containingan estimated 15.9 billion triples.},

The vast amount of available information makes it difficult for researchers to manage the entire KG, which is also continually being edited. It is necessary to develop tools that extract subsets for domains of interest. These subsets will help researchers to reduce costs and time, making data of interest more accessible. In the last two BioHackathons (BH20, BH21), we have created prototypes to extract subsets easily applicable to Wikidata, as well as to define a map of the different approaches used to tackle this problem. Building on those outcomes, we aim to enhance subsetting in both definitions using Entity schemas based on Shape Expressions (ShEx) and extraction algorithms, with a special focus on the biomedical domain. Our first aim is to develop complex subsetting patterns based on qualifiers and references for enhancing credibility of datasets. Our second aim is to establish a faster subsetting extraction platform applying new algorithms based on Apache Spark and new tools like a document-oriented DBMS platform.},

To address this issue, we propose an easy-to-deploy, triple store-agnostic and open-source query editor that offers three main features: (i) automatic query example rendering, (ii) precise autocomplete based on existing triple patterns including within SERVICE clauses, and (iii) a data-aware schema visualization. It can be easily set up with a custom HTML element. The tool has been successfully tested on various public endpoints, and is deployed online at https://sib-swiss.github.io/sparql-editorwith open-source code available at https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-editor.",

	abstract = {RDF shapes are formal expressions of schema structures in RDF data. Their primary purposeis twofold: describing and validating RDF data. However, as machine-readable representationsof the expected structures in a given data source, RDF shapes can be applied to varioustasks that require automatic comprehension of data schemas. In this paper, we present ourwork conducted during the DBCLS BioHackathon 2024 in Fukushima, Japan, to harness thepotential of RDF shapes. The identified and partially implemented use cases include thegeneration and validation of SPARQL queries, data and schema visualization, mappings toother formal syntaxes, and applications in data modeling scenarios.},
